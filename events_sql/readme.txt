PROBLEM:
Write a stored procedure to check if a resource, start and end datetime conflict with existing events.
See the associated table creation sql script, stored procedure creation template script and simple test script.

QUESTIONS:
  1) Does it work?
  2) Is it as simple as possible?
  3) Is it fast? Or to say it more precisely, is it fast enough?
